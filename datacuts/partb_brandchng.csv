Hepatitis A infection can be mild with no symptoms or a severe illness that can rarely cause liver failure and death. Preventing infection can prevent these problems. Hepatitis A vaccine is made from whole, killed hepatitis A virus. It does not contain live virus, so you cannot get hepatitis from the vaccine. This vaccine works by helping the body produce immunity (through antibody production) that will prevent you from getting infection from hepatitis A virus. Hepatitis A vaccine does not protect you from other virus infections (such as HIV virus, which causes AIDS; hepatitis B, hepatitis C or hepatitis E; HPV virus, which causes genital warts and other problems). The vaccine is recommended for people aged 12 months and older, especially those at an increased risk of getting the infection. Those at an increased risk include people who live with or spend much time with people with hepatitis A infections, institutional or daycare workers, lab workers, people with multiple sex partners, men who have sex with men, sex workers, injecting and non-injecting drug abusers, and people traveling to high-risk areas."

Common allergy symptoms relieved by antihistamines include rash, itching, watery eyes, itchy eyes/nose/throat, cough, runny nose and sneezing. It is also used to treat nausea, vomiting and dizziness caused by motion sickness when medication cannot be given by mouth. Diphenhydramine works by blocking a certain natural substance (histamine) that your body makes during an allergic reaction. Its drying effects on such symptoms as watery eyes and runny nose are caused by blocking another natural substance made by your body (acetylcholine). Diphenhydramine should not be used in newborns or premature infants because of an increased risk of side effects. It should not be used for common cold symptoms in children less than 6 years of age due to the risk of serious side effects, such as slow/shallow breathing. Cough-and-cold products have not been shown to be safe or effective in children younger than 6."

Its other effects (such as anti-nausea, calming, pain relief) may work by affecting other natural substances (such as acetylcholine) and by acting directly on certain parts of the brain.

It may also be used to treat milder allergic reactions when you cannot take promethazine by mouth. It may also be used to help you feel sleepy/relaxed before and after surgery, during other procedures, or during labor and delivery. It may also be used to help certain narcotic pain relievers (such as meperidine) work better. Promethazine is an antihistamine and works by blocking a certain natural substance (histamine) that your body makes during an allergic reaction. Its other effects (such as anti-nausea, calming, pain relief) may work by affecting other natural substances (such as acetylcholine) and by acting directly on certain parts of the brain. This drug is not approved for use in children younger than 2 years due to an increased risk of side effects (such as slow/shallow breathing). See also Warning section."

It is also used by people with diabetes who have slow emptying of their stomachs (gastroparesis). Treating gastroparesis can decrease symptoms of nausea, vomiting, and stomach/abdominal fullness.

It also speeds up stomach emptying and movement of the upper intestines. This drug is not recommended for use in children younger than 1 year due to an increased risk of serious side effects (such as muscle spasms/uncontrolled muscle movements).

It is an antibiotic that works by stopping the growth of bacteria. This medication is usually given by injection into a vein. However, the form in vials may also be given by mouth to treat a certain intestinal condition (colitis) that may rarely happen after treatment with antibiotics. This condition causes diarrhea and stomach/abdominal discomfort or pain. When vancomycin is taken by mouth, it stays in the intestines to stop the growth of bacteria that cause these symptoms.

It is also used in women to thin the lining of the uterus (endometrium) in preparation for a procedure to treat abnormal uterine bleeding. Talk to your doctor about the risks and benefits of treatment. Goserelin is similar to a natural hormone made by the body (luteinizing hormone releasing hormone-LHRH). It works by decreasing testosterone hormones in men and estrogen hormones in women. This effect helps to slow or stop the growth of certain cancer cells and uterine tissue that need these hormones to grow and spread.

Histrelin is also used in children to treat early puberty (central precocious puberty). It helps to slow abnormally fast bone development so that height and growth rate are near normal and to stop or reverse signs of early puberty (such as breast/pubic hair growth in girls, pubic hair growth in boys). Histrelin works by reducing the amount of testosterone in boys and estrogen in girls. This medication is used until the doctor decides it is time for puberty to resume."

It is also used along with other medications to treat certain types of stomach cancer. The types of cancers trastuzumab is used to treat are tumors that produce more than the normal amount of a certain substance called HER2 protein. This medication is called a monoclonal antibody. It works by attaching to the HER2 cancer cells and blocking them from dividing and growing. It may also destroy the cancer cells or signal the body (immune system) to destroy the cancer cells.
